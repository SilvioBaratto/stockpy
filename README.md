## Description
**stockpy** is a versatile Python Machine Learning library initially designed for stock market data analysis and predictions. It has now evolved to handle a wider range of datasets, supporting tasks such as regression and classification. It currently supports the following algorithms, each with regression and classification implementations:

- Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN)
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
- Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU)
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Deep Markov Model (DMM) 
- Gaussian Hidden Markov Models (GHMM) 

## Usage
To use **stockpy**, start by importing the relevant models from the `stockpy.neural_network` and `stockpy.probabilistic` modules. The library can be used with various types of input data, such as CSV files, pandas dataframes, numpy arrays and torch arrays.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of stockpy for regression. In this example, we read a CSV file containing stock market data for Apple (AAPL), split the data into training and testing sets, fit an LSTM model to the training data, and use the model to make predictions on the test data:

```Python
from stockpy.neural_network import CNNRegressor
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('stock/AAPL.csv', parse_dates=True, index_col='Date').dropna(how="any")

# Define features and target
X = df[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume']]
y = df['Close']

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

# Scale the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Convert the data to torch tensors
X_train = torch.tensor(X_train, dtype=torch.float)
X_test = torch.tensor(X_test, dtype=torch.float)
y_train = torch.tensor(y_train.values, dtype=torch.float)

# Fit the model
predictor = CNNRegressor(hidden_size=32)

predictor.fit(X_train, 
              y_train, 
              batch_size=32, 
              lr=0.01, 
              optimizer=torch.optim.Adam, 
              epochs=50)
```

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of stockpy for classification. In this example, we read a pickle file containing labeled data, split the data into training and testing sets, fit an LSTM model to the training data, and use the model to make classification on the test data:

```Python
from stockpy.neural_network import LSTMClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, 
                           n_features=20, 
                           n_informative=15, 
                           n_redundant=5, 
                           n_classes=5, 
                           random_state=0)


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.05, shuffle=False)

# Scale the data and convert to torch tensors
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

X_train = X_train.astype(np.float32)
X_test = X_test.astype(np.float32)
y_train = y_train.astype(np.int64)

predictor = LSTMClassifier()

predictor.fit(X_train, 
              y_train, 
              batch_size=32, 
              lr=0.01, 
              optimizer=torch.optim.Adam, 
              epochs=50)
```

The above code can be applied to all models in the library, just make sure to import from the correct location, either `stockpy.neural_network` or `stockpy.probabilistic`.


## Dependencies and installation
**stockpy** requires the modules `numpy, torch, pyro-ppl`. The code is tested for _Python 3_. It can be installed using `pip` or directly from the source cod.

## TODOs
Below is a list of planned enhancements and features that are in the pipeline for **stockpy**. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

- [ ] Implement a dedicated `test` directory with comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and facilitate continuous integration.
- [ ] Expand the documentation to include more detailed tutorials and code explanations, aiding users in effectively utilizing **stockpy**.
- [ ] Enrich the algorithmic suite by adding additional models for regression and classification, catering to a broader range of data science needs.
- [ ] Integrate generative models into the library to provide advanced capabilities for data synthesis and pattern discovery.
- [ ] Develop and incorporate sophisticated prediction models that can handle complex forecasting tasks with higher accuracy.

*Note: A checked box (âœ…) indicates that the task has been completed.*

## Reporting a bug
The best way to report a bug is using the
[Issues](https://github.com/fAndreuzzi/BisPy/issues) section. Please, be clear,
and give detailed examples on how to reproduce the bug (the best option would
be the graph which triggered the error you are reporting).

## How to contribute

We are more than happy to receive contributions on tests, documentation and
new features. Our [Issues](https://github.com/fAndreuzzi/BisPy/issues)
section is always full of things to do.

Here are the guidelines to submit a patch:

1. Start by opening a new [issue](https://github.com/fAndreuzzi/BisPy/issues)
   describing the bug you want to fix, or the feature you want to introduce.
   This lets us keep track of what is being done at the moment, and possibly
   avoid writing different solutions for the same problem.

2. Fork the project, and setup a **new** branch to work in (_fix-issue-22_, for
   instance). If you do not separate your work in different branches you may
   have a bad time when trying to push a pull request to fix a particular
   issue.

3. Run [black](https://github.com/psf/black) before pushing
   your code for review.

4. Provide menaningful **commit messages** to help us keeping a good _git_
   history.

5. Finally you can submbit your _pull request_!
